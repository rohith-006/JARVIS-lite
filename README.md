# JARVIS-lite
Meet JARVIS lite, your mini version of JARVIS with a dash of attitude. It won’t power a full Iron Man suit(YET), but it can search Google, paste copied text for assistance through chat GPT, play music, and open apps listed in the code. Perfect for those who want to feel a bit like Tony Stark—without blowing up their lab.
